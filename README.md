![Countdown Preview](https://github.com/NickZettel/Countdown/raw/main/preview.gif)

A program to place a countdown before live video feeds, in  the style of old flip number alarm clocks. When the countdown reaches zero, the countdown will disappear and the video feed will be visible.

Set a targetDate sometime in the future.

Update switchToVideo() with your video information/ any code that should run when the countdown reaches zero.

If the page loads and the countdown is already passed, the countdown will not show -the video feed will appear instantly.
